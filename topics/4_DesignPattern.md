# Design Pattern
A design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem that arises during software design and development.
Design patterns provide a structured and proven approach to solving common software design problems by defining a set of best practices that can be applied to different situations.

## Adapter
This pattern converts the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect, 
allowing classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- For example, use an abstract class implements an interface, and then extends the abstract class so that we don't have to implement all methods in the interface;

## Template
This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
